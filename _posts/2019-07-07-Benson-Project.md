title: First Week @ Metis - Project Benson
---

First week at Metis Data Science bootcamp has just ended. It's exactly what I thought it would be... very intense and a lot of new things to learn in a short period of time. For me, the most challenging new tool that I learned has got to be Git and GitHub. I'm still not too familiar with the workflow. Hopefully with more practise, it will come naturally to me in no time.

Did I not mention that this Metis's curriculum is very intense already? We were given the first project to complete in 4 days. I worked with another 3 awesome team members
to analyze MTA subway foot-traffic data. The goal of this project was to help a non-profit client to optimize the placement of their street teams at subway stations, such that they could get as many potential commuters as possible to attend the gala.
